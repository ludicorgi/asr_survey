### Audio Evaluation
Take note of the survey code above if you plan on contributing multiple responses. There are a total of 6 unique survey codes.

The remainder of the survey will show you 20 short 3-6 second audio clips, some may be of lower quality. First you are asked type the words in the order that you hear in the audio clip. If some sections of the audio clip sound unintelligible, you may fill the gaps by typing "?" in place of a word. If you found difficulty in identifying or are unsure of a word in your answer, you may also surround the word/s with "?" like "?example answer?". A sample entry of this is shown below. 

Afterwards, rate the quality of the audio clip from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). The score should reflect your listening experience. Refer to the list below for your rating criteria. You may repeat the audio clips as many times as you would like. **Please listen to the audio clips at a comfortable volume while wearing headphones/earphones**

<ul>
  <li>1 - Words can not be understood with any feasible effort</li>
  <li>2 - Words require considerable effort when listening to be understood, may have required several replays of the audio to understand</li>
  <li>3 - Words require moderate effort when listening to be understood</li>
  <li>4 - Words require minimal to no effort when listening to be understood</li>
  <li>5 - Words can be fully understood even when listening passively or without your dedicated attention, did not require replaying to understand</li>
</ul>
