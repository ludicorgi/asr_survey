### Audio Evaluation
The remainder of the survey will show you 24 short 4-12 second audio clips. First you are asked type the words in the order that you hear in the audio clip. If some sections of the audio clip sound unintelligible, you may fill the gaps by typing "?". If you found difficulty in identifying or are unsure of a word in your answer, you may also surround the word with "?" like "?word?". A sample entry of this is shown below. 

Afterwards, rate the quality of the audio clip from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). The score should reflect your listening experience. Refer to the list below for your rating criteria. You may repeat the audio clips as many times as you would like. **Please listen to the audio clips while wearing headphones/earphones and at a comfortable volume**

<ul>
  <li>1 - Words can not be understood with any feasible effort</li>
  <li>2 - Words require considerable effort when listening to be understood, may have required several replays of the audio to understand</li>
  <li>3 - Words require moderate effort when listening to be understood</li>
  <li>4 - Words require minimal to no effort when listening to be understood</li>
  <li>5 - Words can be fully understood even when listening passively or without your attention, did not require replaying to understand</li>
