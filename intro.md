<p>Greetings, We are undergraduate students from DLSU-Manila looking into improving AI models that enhance audio quality. The improvement we seek involves the power, latency and accuracy of the AI model. Your role in this research involves identifying the words spoken in a given audio sample. This allows us to evaluate the effects of AI model compression towards audio quality.</p>
